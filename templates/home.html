            <h4>What is a Registered Agent?</h4>
            <p>
              Registered agents are a responsible third-party that are available
              to receive service of process notes, official correspondence
              including correspondence from the Secretary of State, and any
              other official notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, they are responsible for receiving tax forms, notice of
              lawsuits, and other official notifications that are time-sensitive
              on behalf of your corporation, LLC, or partnership. Registered
              agents are required to have an address in the state where the
              business was registered. A P.O. box does not count as a local
              address since registered agents are required to receive
              time-sensitive information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Why You Need a Registered Agent</h4>
            <p>
              Registered agents come with a lot of benefits. They make the
              management of your business a lot easier, along with several other
              core business advantages. They also offer some core protections
              that help you keep your business and personal life separate.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Avoid Being Served in Front of Family and Friends</h4>
            <p>
              When you’re serving as a registered agent for your own business
              you risk getting served while you are away from your business.
              Since legal notifications are often time-sensitive the person
              serving the documents isn’t likely to wait for a convenient moment
              to deliver the paperwork.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Why are you required to have a registered agent?</h4>
            <p>
              Businesses are required to have a registered agent because
              business correspondence can be unpredictable and very
              time-sensitive, the state needs to know where your business can be
              contacted any day during business hours.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Requirements of a Registered Agent</h4>
            <p>
              Registered agents must be at least 18 years of age, must have a
              physical address in the state where your business is registered,
              and must be available at that address during your hours of
              business.

            <h4>Can You Assign Yourself as a Registered Agent?</h4>
            <p>
              If you live in the same state as your business is registered you
              can assign yourself as a registered agent for your company, but it
              isn’t always a good idea to do so. Being your own registered agent
              can add a lot of complications to your business life.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>
              Are There Any Consequences for Not Having a Registered Agent?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Yes. The most common consequence for not having a registered agent
              is that the state will dissolve your LLC or corporation when the
              problem is discovered. Dissolving your business does not usually
              mean that it is not responsible for its tax obligations, legal
              settlements, or any outstanding debts. If your business is
              dissolved for not having a registered agent your liability
              protection may also be affected.

            <h4>What Does a Registered Agent Do?</h4>
            <p>
              Registered agents essentially provide a point of contact for your
              business in its registered state. They are there to accept a
              service of process legal notifications and tax documents. Good
              registered agents also provide additional services, often
              including company formations, bookkeeping, accounting, virtual
              offices, and mail handling. Not every agent will offer all of
              these services, but most will offer one or two in addition to
              acting as a basic registered agent. They are also responsible for
              accepting legal documents pertaining to any lawsuits or judgments
              involving your business.

            <h4>Avoid Putting Your Address Online</h4>
            <p>
              Having a registered agent helps you avoid putting your personal
              address online as your business address if you don’t have a
              physical office yet.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Assistance with Additional Services</h4>
            <p>
              Since registered agents are usually also qualified business
              professionals in their own right, many also offer other management
              services that take some of the burden out of running your own
              business. Commonly bookkeeping, accepting other kinds of mail, and
              even accounting can be included in their list of services.

            <h4>How to Choose a Registered Agent</h4>
            <p>
              Choosing an agent is an important step in figuring out how your
              business will be run. Any agents in consideration have to meet a
              few requirements, or they won’t count as an agent with the state.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Qualities to Look For?</h4>
            <p>
              You should look for other professional qualifications as well as
              testimonials from their other clients or recommendations from
              their previous employer. Attorneys, CPAs, and fiduciaries are all
              potentially good candidates for a registered agent. Other
              professional qualifications related to business, accounting, or
              financial management are all good signs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What Happens If You Don’t Have a Registered Agent</h4>
            <p>
              Not having a registered agent can mean that your business can’t be
              registered as an LLC or a corporation. Having an agent on paper,
              but who cannot be reached when required for tax documents, legal
              documents and notifications, can cause other problems for your
              business, with the state and with plenty of other entities.

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h4>What is the purpose of a registered agent?</h4>
        <p>
          A registered agent’s basic responsibility is to receive mail and
          notifications on behalf of a business. They are required to be
          available at all times during the business’s normal hours, which frees
          other representatives of the business to leave the office, go on
          vacation, and otherwise be unavailable for official governmental and
          legal correspondence.
        </p>
        <h4>What does it take to be a registered agent?</h4>
        <p>
          The first basic requirement to be a registered agent is that you are
          at least 18 years of age and are considered legally competent. You are
          also required to maintain an address (business or residence) within
          the same state as the business. The address is required to be a
          physical address, PO boxes don't count. Some states also have other
          requirements. For instance, in Virginia, the registered agent must be
          either an attorney or a part of the business's management.
        </p>
        <h4>Can I be my own registered agent in Delaware?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, Delaware allows business people to act as their own registered
          agents in Delaware as long as they meet all other requirements of the
          position. If you serve as your own registered agent you are also
          required to be available during all normal business hours or to have
          another registered agent available in your stead.
