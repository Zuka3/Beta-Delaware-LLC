        <h2>What is a Corporation?</h2>
        <p>
          A corporation is a legal entity that is entirely separate and distinct
          from its owners. Also occasionally called a legal person, corporations
          still enjoy most of the rights and responsibilities that are granted
          to individuals in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Corporations can enter contracts on their own, loan and borrow money
          in their own name, sue and be sued, and hire employees. Corporations
          also own their assets and are independently responsible for paying
          their taxes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>How Do Corporations Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Corporations function as their own legal entity, but they still need
          some management. After all, a corporation can’t sign its own checks,
          calculate its own taxes, or manage its own investments. Corporations
          also certainly can’t form themselves, so you need to know what you’re
          getting into if you’re thinking about starting a corporation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>What is the Process like to Start a Corporation?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s not difficult to start a corporation, but it’s important to make
          sure you’re following the right process to start your corporation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>File Articles of Incorporation</h2>
        <p>
          Corporations are started when a group of shareholders file articles of
          incorporation. You can file articles of incorporation as a sole
          shareholder, or with a group of shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          These forms generally include all the basic information about the
          corporation. That includes the name of the new corporation, its
          address, the agent for service of process, and the amount of stock to
          be released by that corporation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of forms of incorporation as being the step that makes
          everything official. You should have most if not all of the details of
          your corporation worked out by the time you try to file articles of
          incorporation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Board of Directors, Bylaws, and Day to Day Operations</h2>
        <p>
          Most corporations have a Board of Directors that help create the
          bylaws and define the day to day operations of the Corporation. This
          Board is usually composed of shareholders, but in the case of larger
          corporations, it may be limited to shareholders with a bigger
          controlling stake in the corporation as opposed to people with a much
          smaller share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bylaws create a legal background for the corporation to operate under,
          along with the original articles of incorporation. But it’s much
          easier to add and modify bylaws than anything included in the articles
          of incorporation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Do You Need Help Starting a Corporation?</h2>
        <p>
          Because corporations are more complicated than LLCs and other smaller
          business organizations, it’s usually a good idea to get help setting
          up a corporation. It’s not a requirement, but having assistance will
          make the process much easier.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph multi-p">
        <h2>Why Would Someone Want to Start a Corporation?</h2>
        <p>
          There are lots of reasons you might want to start a corporation, and
          everyone’s reasons are a little different. Here are some of the most
          common reasons.
        </p>
        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>Professionalism</h4>
            <p>
              One of the big advantages of incorporating is that your business
              looks more professional to potential clients and customers as well
              as other businesses. Having a corporation makes it look like you
              know what you’re doing and increases your trustworthiness.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Limited Liability</h4>
            <p>
              This goes hand in hand with taxes. Corporations limit liability
              for their actions to the corporation itself. Shareholders, for
              instance, are not responsible if a corporation is in debt, and
              their assets (other than the value in the shares themselves) are
              not as risk. The same goes for the majority shareholder, founder,
              and any employees of the corporation.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>Taxes</h4>
            <p>
              Having a corporation also creates a separate entity when it comes
              to taxes. Especially if you’re the only shareholder that can mean
              greater protection for your assets completely separate from the
              assets of the corporation, which means that your personal property
              isn’t at risk if your corporation runs into trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a corporation can also give you access to different tax
              rates, tax breaks, and other advantages that make tax season more
              affordable for your business.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              Like LLCs and other business structures, corporations also offer a
              level of anonymity if they are created anonymously. That offers
              shareholder protection from the public eye, and can also help
              protect you from reporters and scrutiny about your business
              becoming personal.

          <div>
            <h4>S Corp</h4>
            <p>
              S corporations are usually preferred by smaller businesses, allow
              up to 100 shareholders, and only offer one class of stock. They
              are good for corporations that want to stay small, but not for
              corporations that want to go public or international. These
              corporations also usually have a lot of upkeep.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Non-Profit</h4>
            <p>
              Filing and application fees are higher for non-profit
              organizations, and they are usually used to raise awareness or
              funds for an important cause or issue. Non-profit corporations
              have no individual ownership and have greater reporting and
              administrative requirements than other corporations to make sure
              they stay compliant will all non-profit rules and regulations.

        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>C Corp</h4>
            <p>
              C corporations are a good option for bigger corporations,
              corporations that want to go public, and who want to have
              unlimited shareholders. This is the preferred corporation type if
              you want to bring in outside investors. It also allows
              shareholders to purchase an interest in any other corporation or
              business.

            <h4>Separate Legal Entity</h4>
            <p>
              Because corporations are a separate legal entity, they are a good
              option for protecting your own assets. They also pay their own
              taxes and offer several advantages and protections.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Easier to attract investors</h4>
            <p>
              Having a corporation makes it easier to attract outside investors
              (under some varieties of corporations), who can help raise capital
              for new business ventures, operational funds, and anything else
              you need.

            <h4>Limited Liability</h4>
            <p>
              Limited Liability means that you, as a shareholder or the sole
              shareholder behind your corporation, are shielded from debt
              collections, taxes, and lawsuits filed against your corporation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Easier to attract customers</h4>
            <p>
              Having a corporation also increases your visibility and makes it
              easier to attract customers and clients. As a non-profit, it’s
              also easier to raise awareness of your cause as well as funding.

            <h4>Maintenance is Difficult vs. LLC</h4>
            <p>
              Corporations take a lot more work than LLCs thanks to being a more
              complicated business structure. Even without investors, you should
              expect to spend more time on administrative tasks for your
              corporation.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Potential Double Taxation</h4>
            <p>
              While there are some potential tax advantages, corporations are
              also often subject to a higher tax rate. Depending on the kind of
              corporation you are considering forming, you may be better off
              with an LLC or another business structure with a lower tax burden.

            <p>
              As a corporation, you are responsible for regular reporting to a
              wider group of people. The State and IRS will both require regular
              updates, even if you are the sole investor. You'll need to provide
              quarterly accountings of your business accounts, profits, and
              other management details. If your corporation has investors, they
              will also expect regular updates. Quarterly updates are usually
              considered the minimum, more frequent updates may be beneficial
              or, in some cases, required.

              Corporations tend to be best for groups that are looking to raise
              money from outside investors, or anyone who is looking to raise
              awareness for a specific cause more than they are looking for
              personal gain. Corporations are better for people who are looking
              to create a larger business, as opposed to LLCs that are well
              designed for smaller organizations.

            <h4>What is a corporation in business?</h4>
            <p>
              A corporation is a distinct legal entity able to conduct business
              on its own behalf, including buying and selling property, making
              and receiving loans, owning its own accounts, and other critical
              rights. They are similar to legal persons, though there are still
              a few limitations on the rights and privileges of a corporation.

          <div>
            <h4>What are some examples of corporations?</h4>
            <p>
              Many of the big businesses you interact with every day are
              corporations. Businesses like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google
              are all corporations. Local small businesses may also be
              corporations, especially any that include inc. (for incorporated)
              in their names. If you volunteer with a non-profit, that
              non-profit is also a non-profit corporation.

            <h4>What are the four types of corporations?</h4>
            <p>
              We’ve already discussed three of the four types, but here they
              are:

            </div>
            <p>
              Sole proprietorships are usually smaller, and they are easier to
              set up than other kinds of corporations. However, they don't offer
              any liability protection.
