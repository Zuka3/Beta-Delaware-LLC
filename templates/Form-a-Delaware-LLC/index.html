          Creating an LLC is a good way to protect yourself and your family
          while you’re also going into business for yourself. Starting a small
          business is a huge step, and you need to be informed so you know what
          kind of business will work best for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article will cover everything you need to know to form your own
          LLC in Delaware, from the basics to how it helps protect you.

        <h2>What is an LLC?</h2>
        <p>
          LLCs, or limited liability companies, are a specific business
          structure in the United States designed for small businesses as an
          alternative to sole proprietorships other kinds of business. LLCs act
          as a hybrid entity with some characteristics that are similar to
          corporations, and others that are similar to sole proprietorships and
          partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having an LLC creates a business entity that is responsible for its
          own debts and liabilities, which keeps your business assets separate
          from your personal assets. Under an LLC, the owner(s) is not
          personally liable for the LLC’s debts and liabilities.

        <h2 class="flex-grow-1">Reasons to Form an LLC</h2>
        <p>
          There are several reasons to form an LLC. Having an LLC can help you
          stay organized, create a group organization for you and other members
          of the LLC. Here are some of the core benefits to forming an LLC.
        </p>
        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>Liability Protection</h4>
            <p>
              Liability protection is probably one of the core benefits of
              having an LLC. Once you have an established LLC your assets aren’t
              at risk if your company is sued. It also helps to protect your
              assets if your company goes into debt or runs into other financial
              trouble.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Privacy</h4>
            <p>
              You can also form an LLC anonymously, which can help keep your
              connection to the LLC out of public view. Of course, your bank and
              the government will still know that you’re connected to the LLC,
              especially if you’re the sole member of that LLC. But it will make
              things a little easier to maintain your privacy and keep your
              personal life separate from your business life.
            </p>

        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>Flexible Tax Management</h4>
            <p>
              Because LLCs are created under State governments, they have a lot
              more options when it comes to federal taxes. They can be taxed as
              sole proprietorships and S or C corporations. If you have multiple
              members in your LLC, you can also choose to have your LLC taxed as
              a partnership depending on which tax structure gives your business
              the most advantages.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Professional</h4>
            <p>
              Having an LLC can also make your business appear more professional
              and trustworthy to other businesses and their representatives.
              It’s a good way to indicate that you are serious about what you’re
              doing and that your company is trustworthy.

        <h2>How to Form an LLC</h2>
        <h4>Choose a Location</h4>
        <p>
          The first step to forming an LLC is to choose where your LLC will be
          registered. Generally, you'll form your LLC in your home state since
          that's where it will be active. However, if you're planning to operate
          your LLC in multiple states you have a choice of which state you want
          to register in. Some states are more popular than others based on
          their regulations surrounding LLCs. Here are some of the most popular
          options:
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex">
          <ul>
            <li>Delaware</li>
            <li>Nevada</li>
            <li>New Mexico</li>
            <li>Wyoming</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Choose a Name</h4>
        <p>
          You also need to choose your LLC's name. While the exact requirements
          can vary from place to place, almost every state has these two
          requirements:
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Your name must be unique to you, you cannot register a name
              another business is already registered under in the same state.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must include a variation of Limited Liability Company or LLC
              in the name, usually at the end.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          Your LLC’s official name doesn’t have to be the name you use in public
          in every state. Some states will also allow you to register a separate
          Trade Name that you use in your day to day business dealings.
        </p>
        <h4>Choose a Registered Agent</h4>
        <p>
          As an LLC you are also required to have a registered agent who will
          receive mail and information on behalf of your LLC. They are also
          critical for receiving notice if your LLC has been sued and to receive
          other critical notifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          These agents are also known as your statutory agent or resident agent.
          Your agent is required to have an address in the state your LLC is
          registered. Most LLC’s use a member or employee as their registered
          agent, but you can also use a company that offers registered agent
          services instead.
        </p>
        <h4>Operating Agreement</h4>
        <p>
          Operating agreements aren’t required in every state, but it’s always a
          good idea to have one. Your operating agreement covers all the details
          about how your LLC should be run, including management style,
          leadership, and any other management details.
        </p>
        <h4>Articles of Organization / Formation</h4>
        <p>
          You’ll also need to file Articles of Organization with your state,
          usually with the Secretary of state, the Division of Corporations, or
          your state’s equivalent. Every state uses a slightly different form,
          and some states may also call their form something different. These
          forms declare your LLC and register with the state so that you can
          start doing business. It’s also a way for the state to track your
          business and make sure you’re paying the appropriate state taxes for
          your kind of business.

        <h2>Who Should Start an LLC?</h2>
        <p>
          Starting an LLC is a good idea for anyone with a small business, a
          side business, or even a profitable hobby. Since the main purpose of
          the LLC is protective, they can help keep your personal assets secure
          while you’re pursuing your entrepreneurial dreams.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Who is an LLC best for?</h2>
        <p>
          First, let’s talk about who an LLC isn’t for. LLCs cannot be formed to
          help shield you from the losses associated with a less than a
          profitable hobby or side business. If you flip cars, but usually put
          more money into each vehicle than you get out of it, then you probably
          won't qualify for an LLC.
        </p>
        <p>
          But an LLC might be a good option for a professional makeup artist who
          consistently brings home money and works for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          LLCs might also be a good option if you’re looking to start a business
          and don’t mind investing some of your money as starter funds into
          accounts to get your LLC started.

        <h2 class="flex-grow-1 w-100">FAQs:</h2>
        <div class="column">
          <div>
            <h4>Can I file for an LLC on my own?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes! You can file for an LLC on your own, or with a group,
              whichever arrangement works better for you.

            <h4>What must be filed to form an LLC?</h4>
            <p>
              Forming an LLC isn’t difficult, but you should check your state’s
              local regulations to make sure you aren’t skipping any steps or
              missing anything that could prevent you from completing the
              process. You’ll need to file Articles of Organization (or the
              local equivalent) to form your LLC. You’ll also need a registered
              agent, and a unique business name registered with the state to
              form your LLC.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>Is an LLC really necessary?</h4>
            <p>
              LLCs aren’t strictly necessary, but they are a good idea. Forming
              an LLC can help protect you, but you can also use a different
              business structure if an LLC isn’t a good fit.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What is the purpose of forming an LLC?</h4>
            <p>
              Forming an LLC does a couple of things for you. If you’re the sole
              member of your LLC it can act to protect your resources and create
              a business entity that is separate from your personal property and
              accounts. If you’re forming an LLC with a partner or a group, it
              can help you create a group identity that is distinct from any of
              the members.
