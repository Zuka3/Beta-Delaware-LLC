        <h2>History of Office Cubicles</h2>
        <p>
          Office cubicles are one of the most innovative ideas in the office
          spacing area. They were first invented in 1967 by the designer Robert
          Propst, who worked at Herman Miller. The main idea of these cubicles
          was to solve the needs the employees had in the early 60s. The
          objective was to to define the area that corresponds to each employee,
          giving them some privacy and the ability to personalize the space
          where they should work without the necessity of taking too much space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original idea was to set a two-to three-sided vertical division
          which could define the individual territory of each person and give
          some privacy without the necessity of separating the employee and
          isolating them from the sounds and voices of their office. Initially
          the office cubicles were thought to have a 120-degree angle in each
          corner but they were changed to the 90-degree angle we have today
          because it was more convenient to the employers who can hire more
          employees using the same space. And in that moment the first office
          cubicle was finally designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first business that use this new type of office was the Federal
          Reserve Bank of New York where the AO2, as they used to call them,
          were built in little groups of four coworkers, each of them with their
          own desk and storage. After this office, the cubicles started to gain
          popularity especially in banks and insurance offices after them some
          businesses started adopting this methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays cubicles are built in many different shapes, materials, and
          sizes. In fact the modern office cubicles include some specific
          characteristics in order to make the working hours more comfortable to
          the employee like giving the appropriate illumination to the space and
          also including footrests for each spot. Some other cubicles are not
          more than desks with dividers like the ones you can observe in some
          modern hospitals and banks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The type of cubicles your company needs will depend on what will you
          do in your working space and what type of business are you planning to
          set.

        <h2>Mail Forwarding History</h2>
        <p>
          In the early 1900s, reusable laundry boxes were used by college
          students to deal with their laundry. Mailing dirty clothes was not
          only convenient, but was also a cost saving measure, since mailing
          clothes back home could be cheaper less expensive than visiting a
          professional cleaning service. Because of this, everyone from college
          students to military personnel used them as a way to save time and
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the laundry box designs varied, they all had one thing in
          common: they all had to be durable. The boxes had to be sturdy enough
          to survive being sealed, opened and closed time after time, but they
          also had to be conveniently sized. The National Post Museum has a box
          in its collection that fits that description. Made out of sturdy metal
          and with a frame on its list that allowed for postage information to
          be displayed easily, it’s also of a convenient size, measuring 6 ½ x
          19 ¾ x 12 ¼ inches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common design was with canvas encasings holding a cardboard
          box inside. In 1953, the Official a Postal Guide gave some words of
          advice on mailing clothes in these types of boxes:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Laundry cases of fiber construction, and metal cases to a lesser
          extent, are frequently damaged due to lightweight construction and air
          space contained therein, and address cards are occasionally lost with
          the result that the case goes to the dead Parcel Post Branch. Light
          fiber cases should be boxed to insure arrival in good condition. A
          canvas-covered case with straps around both ends and lengthwise seems
          to carry satisfactorily, provided the address card is secured in the
          flanged label holder by metal clasps fastened on the inside of the
          case of by other suitable means. An address holder similar to that
          used on trunks and suitcases, with a second address inside the case is
          suggested."
        </p>
        <p>
          Two sided address cards cards were used for convenience, but caused
          some confusion at postal offices. They would often warn that
          reutilized address cards had to be free of old stamps and
          endorsements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emergence of the Parcel Post Service in 1913 introduced brought
          about standardized rates and an increase in the allowed weight for
          mailed packages. This lead to wider public acceptance, which in turn
          lead to even better rates and yet another increase in the allowed
          weight for mailed packages. Yale students were some of the first to
          jump into this trend, as an article from 1914 posted in the New York
          Times stated: “In the spring increasing business was done in the
          parcel post section when students found they could send home their
          laundry and get it returned at less than they would have to pay for
          their laundry here. They quickly found out that they could get their
          clothing, books, and room furnishings, except furniture, delivered by
          parcel post for less cost than by express.” In June, the Postal Office
          would be flooded with a mail volume as big as the rest of the year for
          the entire city when students were clearing their dormitories.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1924, the Wellesley, Massachusetts post office estimated that the
          average college student received ten times as much mail than the rest
          of the townspeople. In fact, mailed laundry was so widespread that it
          made up one third of the 252 arriving parcels during the first two
          weeks of the new term. These packages with fresh, crisp clothes
          provided the perfect way to comfort homesick students, by including
          treats inside of them. While regulations called for first-class
          postage to be included in all letters included with the packages,
          there was plenty of room for candies and other goodies to be sent with
          the laundry. Of course, the sender always had to make sure the treats
          didn't ruin the freshly cleaned laundry be securing them well.
        </p>
        <p>
          With automatic machines and new detergent technology, washing clothes
          became an easy task for a single person to do, and mother back at home
          no longer relied on the help to accomplish the chores. Students and
          travelers no longer relied on others, and the introduction of
          Laundromats in the 1930s made it even more convenient. To top it all
          off, bigger wardrobes also meant that less people could fit all their
          clothes into a mailing box. With all these factors, the practice of
          mailing laundry was soon all but forgotten by the 1970s. We hope you
