          When forming an LLC in Colorado, you will need to maintain a
          registered agent. One of the great perks of using our agent service to
          fulfill this requirement, is that we can provide mail scanning and
          mail forwarding services. With our registered agent service, you
          receive five pieces of mail forwarding for free every year. After the
          first five, it is only the charge of postage for mail forwarding. If
          you are looking for solely mail forwarding services, view our options
          below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Mail Service Benefits</h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of reasons why using a mail service can benefit you
          and your business. Some of the most common reasons we see from our
          clients are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Efficiency: </b>
          Our mail service keeps things simple. If you choose to have your mail
          forwarded, we send your packages to whichever location you choose. If
          you choose scanning, simply log in to your online portal at any time
          you want to see your mail. Our service takes the work out of your
          hands and eliminates the need for extra employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Privacy: </b>
          Our mail service offers you an extra layer of privacy. You have the
          option of using our address for both mail and listing on official
          documents. If you combine this with our registered agent and
          incorporation services, your personal information will be completely
          private and free from any publicly available documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Establishing Nexus: </b>
          Our mail service helps you establish corporate nexus. By maintaining a
          physical presence through use of a virtual office, you can establish
          corporate nexus for your Colorado corporation or LLC.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Mail Scanning & Handling</h2>
        <p>
          If you enlist our registered agent services in Colorado, then your
          first five pieces of mail scanning are free each year. Additionally,
          any junk mail or mail associated with registered agent matters is not
          counted towards your five pieces. The only charge your five pieces
          might incur is if forwarding and postage are necessary. Otherwise,
          there is no additional charge. Also, if you enlist our services to
          form your LLC, then the first year of registered agent service is
          free.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our clients expecting a larger package volume, you have the choice
          of selecting from our mail forwarding options (prices are a yearly
          rate):
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex">
          <ul>
            <li>Registered Agent Service: $49</li>
            <li>Monthly: $100</li>
            <li>Weekly: $150</li>
            <li>Daily: $200</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          With these options, the mail scanning is free. The only charge that
          occurs is for postage when necessary. These same price options are
          available for international clients, as it does not make a difference
          where you are located. If you have already registered your LLC or
          corporation with the state but wish to enroll in our virtual office or
          registered agent service (or both), we can make this change for you
          with the Secretary of State. Then, whenever you decide, you can start
          using the new address for any business-related endeavors. Simply login
          to your online client portal to signal the change.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <h2>Physical Address for Your Business</h2>
        <p>
          As one of our clients, you also receive access to our physical
          address. This business address can be used on official document
          filings, business cards, invoices, your website, among others. This
          option is free to you and can aid in convenience and privacy. A
          physical business address helps to elevate our mail service above the
          other options that merely provide a post office box or virtual
          address. A physical address offers a number of benefits and
          opportunities for your business.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto paragraph">
        <a href="{{ url_for('virtual_office') }}">
          <h2>Colorado Virtual Office</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          If you are looking for additional features to include with your
          mailing service, our Colorado virtual office can offer you a business
          address, as well as a commercial lease agreement. The virtual office
          service also includes unlimited phone and mail forwarding. This option
          is great for our clients that value their privacy or want to establish
          nexus in Colorado. Additionally, online companies without a physical
          presence frequently use this option. Our virtual office service also
          allows you the option of renting physical office space if necessary.
