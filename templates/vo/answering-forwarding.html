          In the initial steps of forming your business, establishing a unique
          phone number is most likely a top priority. Not only does it allow you
          to keep personal and business matters separate from one another, but
          it provides a professional display to any prospective clients or
          customers. Depending on your business and its resources and
          priorities, you may find the assistance of a phone service useful.

            <h4>Your Colorado Phone Number</h4>
            <p>
              We offer a number of options for your Colorado phone number,
              though your number can also use the area code of your choosing.
              There are free options available for obtaining your number, or you
              may decide that services like our phone answering and forwarding
              service appeal to you and your business. There is also the option
              of choosing a live answering service for your inbound calls, or
              consider a package deal, such as our
              <a href="{{ url_for('virtual_office') }}">virtual office</a>,
              which includes free phone forwarding.

            <h4>Phone Forwarding Service</h4>
            <p>
              As part of our phone service, we can provide you with a number in
              the area code of your choosing, including the option of a
              toll-free number. However, it is important to note for the
              toll-free option that the number is most commonly an 868
              designation or similar variation, as 1-800 numbers are rarely
              available anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you enlist in our phone service, every aspect can be handled
              within our online portal. The online portal is easy to understand
              and interact with. Any time that you need to change your
              forwarding number, simply update your number in the portal and we
              can handle the rest. There is no additional charge for updating
              your forwarding number and you are free to do so as frequently as
              you wish. Our phone forwarding service is $10 monthly and comes
              with a thousand minutes of talk. Additionally, if required, fax
              numbers are available upon your request. Also, our phone
              forwarding service comes free with the virtual office service.
