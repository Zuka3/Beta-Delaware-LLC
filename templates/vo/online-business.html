            <h4>Research Services</h4>
            <p>
              Nearly every company relies on some form of accurate and timely
              information. The ability to deliver quality and meaningful
              research services is a highly desired skillset. If you possess
              these skills, consider offering your services to media companies
              and other research-heavy industries that rely on facts and quality
              sources.

            <h4>Medical Transcription</h4>
            <p>
              Medical transcriptionists transcribe voice recordings of medical
              reports from doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers. If you
              can listen to audio and type the contents at an effective rate,
              this could be a great choice for you. There is a constant demand
              for this service and not much overhead to get started.

            <h4>Grant Writing</h4>
            <p>
              Hospitals, universities, and non-profits alike all have the need
              for grant writing services. Many organizations rely on grant money
              to supplement their operations. Grant writing, however, can be a
              difficult task for the inexperienced. Whether you have past grant
              writing experience or believe you have the skills required to
              learn and excel at it, there are plenty of opportunities available
              to turn grant writing into a great business.

              Social media continues to grow in popularity and influence. Nearly
              every business, large or small, maintain some form of social media
              presence. If you enjoy the many engaging aspects of social media,
              such as content creation, curation, and connecting with a customer
              base, then consider offering social media consultant services.

            <h4>Cover Letter and Resume Writing</h4>
            <p>
              Anyone looking for a job needs a great cover letter and resume to
              help them stand out from the rest. If you have the skills
              necessary for putting together a strong resume that conveys the
              applicant’s work history and skillset in a strong and compelling
              way, there are many people that would be interested in enlisting
              your services.

            <h4>Menu Planning</h4>
            <p>
              For those of you who enjoy cooking and meal planning, consider a
              menu planning service that offers unique and customized meals. An
              added bonus is if you can provide any culinary or nutritional
              expertise that might set you apart from other traditional options.

              correlating need for copy editors. There is no degree requirement
              for this position, though certain degrees and experience can
              bolster your opportunities. Mainly, the only thing you need are
              provably great proofreading and copy-editing skills.

            <h4>Virtual Assistant</h4>
            <p>
              As more and more businesses move away from a traditional office
              structure, the new position of virtual assistant has been created
              to meet these new needs. For those who are very well-organized and
              detail-oriented, a virtual assistant career could be a great fit.
              The daily tasks of a virtual assistant might include data entry,
              email responses, scheduling, and managing blog and social media
              updates, among many other tasks.

            <h4>Legal Transcription</h4>
            <p>
              Similar to a medical transcriptionist in terms of equipment and
              demand, legal transcriptionists transcribe voice recordings made
              by lawyers, paralegals, and other legal professionals. The work
              can be interesting, as jobs might entail transcribing hearings,
              interrogations, depositions, and client interviews. While no
              training is necessary, any knowledge of legal terminology or
              formatting is beneficial.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Blogging</h4>
            <p>
              A well-run blog can earn profits from selling ad space, hosting
              pay-per-click, and utilizing affiliate links. If you can provide
              insightful information to your audience or find an entertaining
              perspective to share on a given topic, then you can grow your blog
              and its profits. If you can produce consistent content in an
              engaging way, this could be a great opportunity.

            <h4>Online Tutoring & Training</h4>
            <p>
              For those of you who have an interesting skill or body of
              knowledge that can be passed along, online tutoring and training
              offers a great opportunity for you. Through videoconferencing, you
              can teach interested students any number of subjects. This job can
              be done either part-time or full-time as it offers flexibility in
              scheduling. Also, you can work independently or as part of an
              online tutoring company.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Newsletter Subscription Service</h4>
            <p>
              Pick an industry you are passionate about or a subject you have
              great interest in and build a newsletter that can offer worthwhile
              information and updates to subscribers who share those same
              passions and interests. Additionally, as your newsletter improves,
              your customers will share it with others and interest will grow,
              potentially leading to new opportunities for promotion with
              businesses.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Translation Services</h4>
            <p>
              If you are an individual who is multilingual, there are plenty of
              great opportunities available to you. As markets grow increasingly
              global in reach, businesses need individuals who can assist them
              in their operations. For example, these jobs could range from
              translating documents to assisting in cross-cultural marketing
              efforts.
